# Bi-Pedal_walker
The bi-pedal walker code is a program that simulates the movement of a walking robot with two legs. The code is designed to control the motion and balance of the walker, mimicking the locomotion of a human or animal. The walker is represented by a simulated model consisting of two legs with joints and actuators.
